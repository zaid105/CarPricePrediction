##    **Problem Statment**
The Aim of this project is to build or develop a Machine Learning model to predict the price of used car at reasonable rate.In this model we used Random Forest Regressor to predict price of used car based on its feaures like manufacturing years, showroom price, kilometer driven, fuel types, number of sellers , transmission types & owners etc. A customer or buyer or seller may know actual market price or values before purchasing or selling of his/her car. In this project we implement and evaluate various learning methods of machine learning on this dataset.

etc.



## Model Training
The machine learning model was trained using the many diffrent regression models 
<br>eg:- Linear Regression, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradiant Boosting tc

## Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error...
